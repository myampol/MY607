## Assignment 2: Movies Database

###  __Already done:__

####  Choose six recent popular movies. 
####  Ask at least five people that you know (friends, family, classmates, imaginary friends) 
####  to rate each of these movies that they have seen on a scale of 1 to 5. 
####  Take the results (observations) and store them in a SQL database. 

###  __To be done here:__    Load the information into an R dataframe, and examine it.


##### Load up some libraries
```{r load-libraries, eval=TRUE}
library(RMySQL)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(psych)
```

##### Connect to the MySql database and retrieve the data:
```{r get-the-data, eval=TRUE}

# I created "stduser" as a read-only account in my database which only has "select" privilege
connstd <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user="stduser", password="password", 
                     dbname="Week2_Movies", host="localhost")

# create a query which joins the 3 database tables, 
# replacing the auto-generated ID codes with the movie names and the reviewers' names

query <- 'Select M.Movie_title, F.Friend_name, R.Rating
          From Movies as M, Friends as F, Ratings as R
          Where (M.Movie_id = R.Movie_ID AND F.Friend_id = R.Friend_ID);'

# execute the query
result <- dbGetQuery(connstd, query)

# close the database connection
discard <- dbDisconnect(connstd) # this function returns "TRUE", so assignment suppresses printing
```

##### The dimensions of the results dataframe are `r dim(result)` .

```{r what-did-we-get, eval=TRUE}

# structure of the results dataframe
str(result)
```

```{r what-did-we-get2, eval=TRUE}
# summary of the results dataframe
summary(result)

```

##### List the results (there are only 30 rows):
```{r show-the-data, eval=TRUE}
result
```

##### Describe the results:
```{r describe the ratings, eval=TRUE}
describe(result$Rating)
```
##### (Note that there is one "NA" value, which we will have to exclude later.)


#### Let's look at the results, grouped by __Movie__  :
```{r describe-by-Movie, eval=TRUE}
describeBy(result$Rating,group = result$Movie_title )
```

##### We need to drop the item with the NA rating in order to obtain non-NA summary results.

##### Subsetting using __!is.na(result$Rating)__  :

```{r summarize-by-Movie, eval=TRUE}
result[!is.na(result$Rating),] %>%
  group_by(Movie_title) %>%
  summarize(count=n(),
            min=min(Rating),
            mean=mean(Rating),
            median=median(Rating),
            max=max(Rating),
            sd=sd(Rating),
            IQR=IQR(Rating)
            )
```

##### Now, let's make a boxplot by __Movie__ :
```{r boxplot-by-Movie, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(result, aes(x=Movie_title, y=Rating, fill=Movie_title)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
```

###### We can see that Ocean's 8 was quite popular, with mean and median ratings of 4:
```{r}
result[result$Movie_title=="Ocean's 8",]
```

###### while Peter Rabbit was at the opposite end of the spectrum, receiving the lowest ratings:
```{r}
result[result$Movie_title=="Peter Rabbit",]

```



#### Now, Let's look at how each __friend__ tended to rate the films:
```{r describe-by-Friend, eval=TRUE}
describeBy(result$Rating,group = result$Friend_name )
```

##### Again, we have to exclude the item with the NA:
```{r summarize-by-Friend, eval=TRUE}
result[!is.na(result$Rating),] %>%
  group_by(Friend_name) %>%
  summarize(count=n(),
            min=min(Rating),
            mean=mean(Rating),
            median=median(Rating),
            max=max(Rating),
            sd=sd(Rating),
            IQR=IQR(Rating)
            )
```


```{r boxplot-by-Friend}
ggplot(result, aes(x=Friend_name, y=Rating, fill=Friend_name)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
```

###### We observe that Bob either likes a film or hates it -- with Bob, there is no middle ground.  
###### Bob gave the widest disperion among his ratings, using mostly "1"s and "5"s, which explains his large IQR and standard deviation.  
######His Median is the lowest, as half his ratings were "1"s:
```{r}
result[result$Friend_name=="Bob",]
```


###### Because Dave gave so many ratings of "2", his IQR = 0, thus his box is flat, with outliers at "1" and "5" :

```{r}
result[result$Friend_name=="Dave",]
```


##### Conclusion:  With a small data set (6 movies and 5 reviewers) the aggregated figures display interesting results across both movie and reviewer.  
##### It would be interesting to see the results across a larger sample, for example using the data assembled by "Rotton Tomatoes" which tabulates published movie reviews and scores films on a scale of 0%-100% based upon the percentage of reviews which are favorable vs. unfavorable.  
##### Furthermore, it would be interesting to compare/contrast such "professional" assessments with opinions from individuals, such as those assembled by firms like Amazon.
